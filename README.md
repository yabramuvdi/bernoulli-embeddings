# bernoulli-embeddings

This repository provides a Python implementation -using JAX-  of the Bernoulli Embeddings developed by [Rudolph et al. (2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00778). Bernoulli Embeddings are a particular class of Exponential Family Embeddings where dense low-dimensional representations of items are constructued by relying on co-occurence patterns.

For a complete example on how to estimate these embeddings on a particular dataset check [this blog post](https://yabramuvdi.github.io/movies_embeddings_estimation/) which uses movie ratings data to construct embedded representations of movies.
